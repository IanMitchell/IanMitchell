# Heya!

👋 My name is Ian Mitchell (he/him), and I'm a software engineer from Seattle, Washington, specializing in front-end development (mostly using React). I've been doing web development for a long time now - I'm one of those ones that finds CSS fun, and tries to use it as much as possible.

## Recently...

[Interaction Kit](https://github.com/ianmitchell/interaction-kit) is a Discord HTTP bot framework I'm using to learn more about the Discord API and TypeScript.

[sentrydiscord.dev](https://github.com/ianmitchell/sentrydiscord.dev) is a popular tool I developed for forwarding sentry alerts to a Discord server.

My [personal website](https://github.com/ianmitchell/ianmitchell.dev) is a little more developer-focused, relying on MDX and custom CSS to give me maximum flexibility with my content.

[Ramble](https://ramble.pub) is a Bluesky web client using Next.js and React Server Components (currently closed source)

[Starboard](https://github.com/ianmitchell/starboard) is a Discord bot I recently built primarily for my community server.

I also wrote and maintain [Deschtimes](https://github.com/ianmitchell/deschtimes), a project-management solution for foreign media translation groups.
