# Heya!

👋 My name is Ian Mitchell (he/him), and I'm a web developer from Seattle, Washington. I work at Discord on the Bots and API team, where I do front-end development using React. I've been doing web development for a long time now - I'm one of those ones that finds CSS fun, and tries to use it as much as possible.

## Recently...

I've been spending the past year in quarantine updating my personal blog and writing articles elsewhere, which has lead to a focus on blog software and discord utilities.

[Ramble](https://github.com/ianmitchell/ramble) is an IndieWeb blogging platform I've been trying to invest more time into. It's not anything special right now, but I do have some fun plans for it. I hope to replace a few Ghost blogs I run with it.

My [personal website](https://github.com/ianmitchell/ianmitchell.dev) is a little more developer-focused, relying on MDX and custom CSS to give me maximum flexibility with my content.

[Aquarius](https://github.com/ianmitchell/aquarius), [sentrydiscord.dev](https://github.com/ianmitchell/sentrydiscord.dev), [discord-notifier](https://github.com/ianmitchell/discord-notifier), and [jest-discord](https://github.com/ianmitchell/jest-discord) are all bots and related tooling I've developed as more and more of my services centralize around Discord. I have a few other Discord bots and projects around, too.

I also wrote and maintain [Deschtimes](https://github.com/ianmitchell/deschtimes), a project-management solution for foreign media translation groups.
